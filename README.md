The project labeled 'Clustering' is about kclusters and how to use the unsupervised learning method. 
The objectives:
  * Build your DataFrame and define your ML problem
  * Prepare your data by cleaning the data and performing feature engineering
  * Perform KMeans Clustering and analyze the results
  * Perform Hierarchical Clustering and analyze the results

The project labeled 'Implement Neural Networks' is about using neural networks with the keras package for a binary classification problem.
Overall, it demonstrates practice
