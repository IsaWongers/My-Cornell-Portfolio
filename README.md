The project labeled 'Clustering' is about kclusters and how to use the unsupervised learning method. Using the World Happiness data, the model groups data points based on patterns and similarities. It's a good way to observe the similarities and differences between large masses of countries.

The project labeled 'Implement Neural Networks' is about using neural networks with the keras package for a binary classification problem.
Overall, it demonstrates a models that predicts whether or not an AirBnB host is a superhost based on the data given.

Finally, the 'WORLD Happiness FINAL' project uses the World Happiness data to predict happiness based on the life expectancy at birth. This regression model has potential to be used for observing prosperity in different countries. In theory, people are happier if they live longer and more factors are included at the end.
