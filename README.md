The project labeled 'Clustering' is about kclusters and how to use the unsupervised learning method. 
The objectives:
  * Build your DataFrame and define your ML problem
  * Prepare your data by cleaning the data and performing feature engineering
  * Perform KMeans Clustering and analyze the results
  * Perform Hierarchical Clustering and analyze the results

The project labeled 'Implement Neural Networks' is about using neural networks with the keras package for a binary classification problem.
Objectives:
  * Build your DataFrame and define your ML problem:
  * Load the Airbnb "listings" data set
  * Define the label - what are you predicting?
  * Identify the features
  * Prepare your data so that it is ready for modeling.
  * Create labeled examples from the data set.
  * Split the data into training and test data sets.
  * Construct a neural network.
  * Train the neural network.
  * Evaluate the neural network model's performance on the training, validation and test data.
  * Experiment with ways to improve the model's performance.
